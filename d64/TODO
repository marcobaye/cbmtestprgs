maybe add a way to enter a disk image inside a disk image? needed?


some form of "create d64/d71/d81/... file"
some form of format() or mkfs() call?
some form of "write this string to free area of t18s0"


honor error info


d64_apply_dirart.py: add a warning/error if subdirs are found, because their dir
entries cannot simply be moved around without adjusting their back links!


add a way to set disk name and 5-char-id
add a way to read/write/allocate/free block
	mainly for writing boot block
add a way to store a file to disk
	nonstd_interleave
		1541 uses 10 (Jiffy uses 6 for PRG and 10-12 for SEQ/REL/USR, depending on track)
		1571 uses 6 (Jiffy uses 4 for PRG and 8-10 for SEQ/REL/USR, depending on track)
		1581 uses 1
	keep_on_first_side (for 1571 img)
	interleave_sides (for 1571 img: treat tracks 36..70 as extensions of tracks 1..35)
	if_disk_full_use_dir_track
	put_on_dir_track_right_away
		1541/71 uses interleave 3 for dir, so the chain goes on like this:
		s0 (header block, links to s1, but dir starts at s1 regardless)
		s1 s4 s7 s10 s13 s16 (there is no s19, so wrap)
		s2 s5 s8 s11 s14 s17 (there is no s20, so wrap)
		s3 s6 s9 s12 s15 s18 (no blocks left)
		...sooo use these blocks in reverse order? or maybe just live
		with the fact that the dir interleave is not 3 on this disk!
