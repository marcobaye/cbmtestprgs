maybe add a way to enter a disk image inside a disk image? needed?


some form of format() or mkfs() call?


_IMGMODE_READONLY = 0       # trying to write raises Exceptions
_IMGMODE_RAM = 1            # changes are made in RAM only
_IMGMODE_WRITEBACK = 2      # flush changes to file by calling writeback()
_IMGMODE_WRITETHROUGH = 3   # all changes are written to file immediately
...or maybe better "from enum import Enum"!
